# Relics

Relics is a mod for Minetest which adds rare and strange relics to the game.

Every so often when you mine, you will come across a buried relic. Depending on how deep you are, mining this will give you different relics.

## Relic List

### Repair Paste

Depths: 0 - 1000

Repair Paste is used to repair a vast range of items. Crafted with any damaged tool, it will repair 1/3 of the durability of that tool. It also functions as a food.

### Flakey Pick

Depths: 500 - 1000

The Flakey Pick appears to be a weak pick at first, but as the wear on the tool increases, it becomes sharper and will mine faster and faster.

### Glass Heart

Depths: 1000 - 2000

When the Glass Heart is placed on the ground, any damage that a player takes within 10 blocks will fill up the heart, to a maximum of 100 hp. When carrying the heart, damage the player would take is taken out of the heart instead.

### Portable Hole

Depths: 1000 - 2000

When the Portable Hole placed on a block, all blocks up to 10 blocks behind it will be 'phased out' of existence. Removing the Portable Hole will 'phase in' those blocks again.

### Second Glass

Depths: 2000 - 3000

The Second Glass will trigger timers on any block beneath it once a second. This makes it especially good for growing crops or speeding up smelting. The Second Glass can also be stacked to trigger even faster.

### Strange Compass

Depths: 500 - 2000

The Strange Compass will, when used, emit a particle which travels to the nearest ore within 10 blocks, choosing higher level ores first.

### Universal Solvent Container

Depths: 3000 - ?

The Universal Solvent will dissolve all nodes it comes into contact with, and can only be contained inside the Universal Solvent Container. It is not to be trifled with.

### Bright Lantern

Depths: 1500 - 2500

The Bright Lantern is an unusually bright light source capable of illuminating anything within 5 blocks.
